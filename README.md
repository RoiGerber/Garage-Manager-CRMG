# Garage-Manager-CRMG
a CRM (costumer relationship manager) project for garages.

# Boring background story:
      After my successful scheduling project for the navy, i left the army.
      a month later, the maintenance manager of all the ships in our base that he has an offer.
      his brother, a handy man by himself, has a garage. 
      a 20 years old garage!
      his clients were "organized" in Binders and notebooks. hundreds of pages.
      he asked my to sell him a CRM sotfware.
      
# Technologies:
  this project is made with Python.
  it uses a not so popular environment and ui extension of python - "QT creator"
  since the system can send SMS, it is interfacing with "Twilio".
  
# So, what is it all about?

  the CRMG is a neat, comfortable, easy-to-use software for managing garages costumers.
  
  each contact is a former costumer and has a simple contact page with his details: car model, date, latest problem etc.
  
  the software has the ability to send SMSs with an alpha-numeric name.
  the whole point is filtering the contacts and sending them a costum sms,
  for example: sending all the jeep owners that new spare parts arrived and they are sold in 50% discount
  
  the contacts and their details are organized in a Json file, therefore can easily be transfared to an excel table.
