# So, what is it all about?

  each contact is a former costumer and has a simple contact page with his details: car model, date, latest problem etc.

  the software has the ability to send SMSs with an alpha-numeric name.
  the whole point is filtering the contacts and sending them a costum sms,
  for example: sending all the jeep owners that new spare parts arrived and they are sold in 50% discount

  the contacts and their details are organized in a Json file, therefore can easily be transfared to an excel table.
